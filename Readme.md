# rcpp_cms

This is an experimental project, to implement a html framework in c++, because I'm dissatisfied with 
every single framework that I've seen or used so far.

Developing websites nowadays feels more like creating a bunch of oneliner files all over the place, 
which I find incredibly annoying and distracting. Not only that I'm also dissatisfied with the way most 
ORMs are built, they always come off as strange to use, especially with joins. At this point I'm so fed up,
I'd rather use raw SQl. And let's not forget about auth, I have to think about implementing auth way too 
much. Every single time.

I think things can be done better. At lest from my perspective.

Whether this stupid and moronic attempt will end up working or not, we'll see.
